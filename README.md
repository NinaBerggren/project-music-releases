# Music Releases

Nina Berggren & Lisa Johansson DreamTeam

This project we practiced React and created components by using data from Spotify. We build a page which shows new album and single releases 2019.

## The problem

This week we struggled with lack of instructions for how to start the project and the interferance of the eslint-file. In planing stage we tried to have album cover as a component but we couldn't get it to work, don't know why, we worked around the issue.

If we hade more time, we would try to get the album cover component to work.
